# sonic-dev

A self-contained SONiC virtual testbed for developing, testing and benchmarking the
transceiver daemon (`xcvrd`) — including an automated pipeline that translates it from
Python to Rust and grades the result.

Everything runs on one Linux host with nested virtualization: a KVM SONiC DUT, its
neighbor VMs, a `sonic-mgmt` container, and an emulated transceiver plant. No physical
optics required.

```

## Running it

`setup-sonic-testbed.sh` is the interface to the whole repo — 1 700 lines, ~34 phases,
each idempotent and individually re-runnable. Build the testbed from nothing:

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh                 # runs every setup phase in order
```

Then drive it a phase at a time:

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh emulator                              # deploy the emulated optics
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_tests                           # black-box suite vs stock python xcvrd
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_tests_rust recodeAgent/results/result_4
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_status                          # which daemon is live?
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_restore                         # un-strand an injected rust daemon
```

Tab completion:

```bash
eval "$(./setup-sonic-testbed.sh --completion bash)"
```

USAGE
  ./setup-sonic-testbed.sh [<phase>] [args...]
  ./setup-sonic-testbed.sh --help | --list-phases | --completion bash

  With no phase it runs all (every setup phase in order). Every phase is
  re-runnable on its own.

Each directory carries its own README with the detail.

## How the pieces fit

**The emulator replaces hardware.** `platform/` implements the SONiC platform API over
gRPC to `xcvr-emu`, so an unmodified `xcvrd` reads and writes EEPROM on emulated optics.
`emu-deploy/` installs it. This is what makes plugging, faulting and reconfiguring a
transceiver a scripted operation.

**`xcvrd-tests/` is the correctness oracle.** It never imports the daemon — it drives
stimulus through the emulator and reads STATE_DB, so the same suite grades any
implementation. That independence is why it can serve as the pipeline's verdict.

**`recodeAgent/` produces the translations** under `results/result_N`, each graded by
that suite via `xcvrd_tests_rust`. `CodeWeaver/` is the same pipeline generalized —
identical agent methodology, but every project-specific detail lives in a config file,
so it translates arbitrary codebases rather than only `xcvrd`.

**`benchmark/` measures them.** The DUT harness benchmarks the real supervised process
(works for any translation); the in-process harness links a translation as a library for
per-task detail. See `benchmark/README.md`.

**`sonic-platform-daemons/` is where a finished translation is published.** A fork of the
upstream repo whose `sonic-xcvrd-rust` branch carries the Rust daemon as a sibling of the
Python `sonic-xcvrd/` it replaces — the same tree as `recodeAgent/results/result4_optimized/crate`,
but laid out where it would actually ship. Pinned here as a submodule so this repo records
exactly which translation was published.

## Requirements

A Linux host with nested virtualization, passwordless sudo, docker, and a large data
mount (default `/mnt/data`). `./setup-sonic-testbed.sh preflight` checks all of it and
`install_prereqs` installs the rest.

Clone with submodules (`xcvr-emu`, `CodeWeaver`, `sonic-platform-daemons`):

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gsoosk/sonic-dev
# already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Troubleshooting

### `No route to host` / `Connection closed` talking to the DUT

```
[ship] scp image + bundle + scripts to DUT
ssh: connect to host 10.250.0.101 port 22: No route to host
```

`No route to host` is an L2/L3 failure, not an SSH one — ARP never resolved, so
nothing is at that address. (Contrast `Connection refused` = host up, sshd down;
`Connection timed out` = reachable but filtered.) Almost always this is a host that
rebooted: `br1` and the VMs do not survive one.

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh fix_dut_network     # diagnose + repair, then prove it
```

That attaches the DUT's mgmt tap (`vlab-01-0`) to `br1` and pings the DUT from the
`mgmt` container. It is idempotent, so it is safe to run when you are only guessing.
If it still cannot reach the DUT it prints the remaining suspects in order.

Full post-reboot recovery:

```bash
docker start mgmt ptf_vms6-1
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh setup_mgmt_network   # recreate br1
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh start_vms
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh add_topo             # now attaches the DUT tap itself
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh deploy_mg
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh emulator
```

**Why the tap needs attaching at all.** sonic-mgmt's `add-topo` enslaves the
*neighbour* VMs' `-m` interfaces to `br1` but not the DUT's own tap. Everything then
looks healthy — the VM runs, `br1` exists, `virsh list` is happy — while the DUT is
invisible on the mgmt network. `add_topo` now does this itself, so a fresh setup and
a recovery both end with a DUT that is actually reachable rather than one that only
looks deployed.

### Which xcvrd is live?

```bash
./setup-sonic-testbed.sh xcvrd_status    # PYTHON (stock) vs RUST (xcvrd-rs)
```

Read-only: reports supervisor state, the running process image, and the
inject/backup markers. Useful after an interrupted benchmark or validation run,
which restore the Python daemon on exit but cannot if they are killed outright.
